<h2>Epic Armageddon Ragnarök</h2>

<p class="lead">
    Welcome to Epic Armageddon Ragnarök. On these pages you will find fan based lists and scenarios for Epic Armageddon developed by the EA:Ragnarök team. A lot of list foundations and ideas are credit to the NetEA group, Epic-UK group and the F-ERC group. We have done this project because we really enjoy the game, scenario and list development. We hope we have created a fresh new vibe on the game, and we aim for some fun gaming sessions.
</p>

<p>
    These list are still in development, but we feel we have reached a point where they are ready for a public beta. We invite you to comment/bring ideas to the table through our <a href="https://discord.gg/J74rgpnXKg" target="_blank" class="external">EA:Ragnarök discord</a>. With epic being out of production for many years now, our gaming friends are far and wide for us. We play a lot of games online and invite you to also join in online games through the discord channel. On the <a href="content/online.html">Online Gaming</a> page you will find tutorials and links to play games via Tabletop Simulator. This software is available on steam for a few dollars. Special thanks to 'Norto' for a ton of the initial work on this project.

<h3>Battle Reports</h3>
<p>
    We have done a few battle reports during our play-testing, to showcase the EA:Ragnarök armies. We hope to grow this collection over time, so check it out and subscribe to our Youtube channel for updates when we release new material.

<h3>EA:Ragnarök design</h3>

<p>
    We have looked into a number of areas when designing EA:Ragnarök, not only army lists. One of the most important changes is the new scenario <a href="content/scenarios/fire.html">Fire the Beacons</a>, which should be considered the standard scenario for EA:Ragnarök. While the rules and victory conditions are familiar from the NetEA standard scenario, in Fire the Beacons you accumulate points from the first turn onwards. Epic is a game about maneuvering and positioning formations on the battlefield to gain an advantage over your opponent, and putting Victory Conditions in focus already from turn one emphasizes this aspect of the game.
</p>
<p>
    As a positive side effect Fire the Beacons also discourages some of the more extreme armies such as extremely air-heavy lists, lists that enter the board via drop/tunneling/teleport on turn three etc. The EA ruleset was not designed for these kinds of armies and does not handle them in a good way. We want the armies to play nice with the core rules, and the Fire the Beacons scenario was one way of restricting players when building their armies without a complete overhaul of all army lists. Fire the Beacons also discourages defensive armies that can be very frustrating to face, where your opponent only sits back and shoot you as you move in.
</p>
<p>
    We have also been looking at the Epic Armageddon core rules. We dont want to do changes to the core rules but there are a number of rules that can be interpreted in more than one way. We have tried to write down how we would like the rules to be interpreted in EA:Ragnarök games. We also added a few house-rules that we think will make the game better, such as the <i>Scouting from behind</i>. Our interpretations and house-rules can be found at the <a href="content/rules">Rules page</a>. We have also tried to get more diverse terrain on the epic tables, without breaking the balance of the game. On the <a href="content/terrain">Terrain page</a> we have introduced a number of new terrain types, and also revised some of the standard Epic terrain in an attempt to make it more interesting.

<h4>Army Lists</h4>
<p>
    We have designed a wide range of armies for you to play in your EA:Ragnarök games. A lot of list foundations and ideas are credit to the NetEA group, Epic-UK group and the F-ERC group, but all lists has received changes. We have tried to give each list its own unique feeling and playstyle. As mentioned above we want the armies to play nice with the epic core rules, so some of the most extreme armies (like Necrons) have received major changes to act more like a "normal" epic armies. We have done a few general changes across all EA:Ragnarök lists that we hope will improve the game, and overall list design.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Titans:</b> We wanted Titans to be a more common sight in Epic. Looking at NetEA and Epic UK we thought there were a few issues
    with Titans: They are generally too expensive for the damage output they bring and in many cases they require specialized formations to bring them down, which some armies lack. We have introduced a general weakness to being swarmed by enemy infantry, reducing close combat values and number of extra attacks on titan close combat weapons. We have also introduced the <i>God Machine</i> and <i>Split Fire</i> special rules for large (8+ DC) titans, which both makes them better and introduces a weakness...
</p>
<p>
    <b>Knights:</b> We felt that the War Engine rules did not work well when the War Engines were taken in large formations. They block line of sight for each other, both for shooting and fire-fights, and assaults were very challenging if played by the book. In an attempt to fix this we have introduced a new type of unit: Heavy Armoured Vehicle (H-AV). This is used for Knights and similar units like e.g. Stompas as well as some larger tanks. Details on the Heavy Armoured Vehicle rules can be found in the army lists, but on a high level they behave like an Armoured Vehicle with 2 DC.
