<h2>Battle Line</h2>
<p class="lead">
    The Battle Line scenario is based on the scenario described in the
    <a href="https://tp.net-armageddon.org/tournament-pack/#epic-tournament-game-rules">NetEA Epic Tournament Game
        Rules</a>. The scenario description below describes how the Battle Line scenario differs from the NetEA
    original. Any sections not mentioned here, such as Setup, Pre-game discussions, etc, uses the exact rules from the
    NetEA original.
</p>

<h4>Place Objective Markers</h4>
<p>In addition to standard objective placement rules the Blitz objective must be placed at least 15cm away from any
    corner, and the remaining two objectives must be set up at least 15cm away from any board edge. Also, you may not
    place objective markers in terrain that is impassable for any unit type.</p>

<h4>Victory Conditions</h4>
<p>Same as the NetEA Epic Tournament Game Rules, with the following changes:</p>
<p>As usual, units from broken formations or from formations that have rallied that End Phase cannot capture or contest
    objectives, but this also includes "They Shall Not Pass" victory condition. In addition, Aircraft which have landed
    may neither capture nor contest objectives or deny "They Shall Not Pass" on the same turn that it lands.</p>

<p>If at the end of turn 1 or 2 a player has a 4 or 5 victory condition lead over his opponent then the game ends. Compare
    victory conditions and calculate the scenario score as if the game had ended in turn 3.</p>

<p>You must check to see if either player has won at the end of the third and fourth game turns. If neither player has
    won at the end of the fourth turn then consult the table below to calculate scenario scores. No 'tiebreak' or
    'victory points' are used in this scenario.</p>
