<h4>Version 1.0.beta</h4>
<p>
    The EA:Ragnarök Adepta Sororitas list is based on the E-UK version of the list, but with some siginficant changes to force structure, stats and special rules.
</p>
<p>
    Faithful: The Faithful rule has been revised succeed automatically, but only if the formation carries out an Engage action that leads to an Assault. This makes this rule less abusable, in particular it prevents Fearless scouts from marching up and blocking off entire sections of the battlefield. In addition, formations that use the Faithful rule counts as having a character with 'Inspiring' in the formation.
</p>
<p>
    The Exorcists have been split into two versions (one direct fire (Prioris) and one equipped with a Whirlwind Missile Launcher (Sanctorum)). The Exorcist Prioris have longer range but worse AT. It also have a 5+ Armour, since it is based on the Rhino.
</p>
<p>
    Battle Sisters: This formation have had their Heavy Flamers replaced with Heavy Bolters, as we found them to be somewhat too strong with Heavy Flamers. Battle Sisters Mission is also the sole Core formation in the Army, but is more flexible with options to replace Battle Sisters with Exorcist Prioris or to ride in a Sororitas Stormlord.
</p>
<p>
    No mixed Sister formations: In order to reduce confusion for players (there are quite a few types of "Sisters" in the list), each type of Sister unit now has its own type of formation, with the Celestial Sisters merging with the Immolator formation to create a quite expensive but very nasty Immolation formation.
</p>
<p>
    Machine Spirits: Certain units which are basically servitors and are regarded as cannon fodder have been given the Machine Spirit rule, and are also Fearless and Expendable. These units are now upgrades to the Redemptionist formation.
</p>
<p>
    Imperial Navy: The Lightning Strike Fighters have been replaced with the Lightning Interceptor, and the ground attack role been taken over by the Marauder Destroyer, which also replaces the Marauder Squadron. Since the list now contains Exorcist Sanctorums these are less needed.
</p>

<h5>Additional nerfs, boosts & tweaks</h5>
<ul>
    <li>The Inquisitor formation can now contain a Supreme Commander.</li>
    <li>A formation of four Hellhounds have been added to the list.</li>
    <li>Rhinos are no longer free, but must be bought as an upgrade. This makes it more attractive to take other kinds of transport.</li>

</ul>
<h4>Version 1.0.beta-2</h4>
<p>
