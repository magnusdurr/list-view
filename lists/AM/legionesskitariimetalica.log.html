<h4>Version 1.0.beta</h4>
<p>
    The EA:Ragnarök 'Legiones Skitarii: Metalica' list is based on the Epic UK version of Skitarii, with some inspiraton drawn from the NetEA version, and like those lists it is intended to represent the 'old' Skitarii, which can ally with Paladins from the Knight World list. New Skitarii units will be covered by 'Legiones Skitarii: Mars'.
</p>
<p>
    Machine Spirit: Robots now work very differently to NetEA or Epic UK. Generally Light Vehicles that are Fearless, Expendable, the Ponderous special rule, and the reworked Machine Spirit rule, these need a non-Machine Spirit unit to be able to use their special rules most efficiently. Praetorians, which were very effective in the E-UK version, are now also considered a kind of Robot that needs someone to order them around.

<h5>Additional nerfs, boosts & tweaks</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Chimedons: In addition to the Chimeras, the Hypaspist and Ballistae Cohort can now take Chimedons as well.</li>
    <li>The Sagitarii formation (Ballistae Cohort) is now smaller and cheaper, giving the list a much-needed fast formation.</li>
    <li>The Ordinatus Minoris formation is slightly more expensive, and has access to a few new weapon options.</li>
    <li>The Ordinatus Majoris is significantly cheaper, as it is a very fragile formation, and is no longer 1+ in Initiative Rating.</li>
    <li>The Cataphractii Maniple is slightly cheaper, and can now also take Leman Russ Demolishers and Executioners.</li>
    <li>Warhounds now has access to more weapon options. The Reaver and Warlord inherits the changes made to them throughout EA:Ragnarök.</li>
    <li>Skitarii now has its own Navy, with Avenger Strike Fighters and Ark Mechanicus Battleships taking the place of the Imperial Navy options.</li>
</ul>
