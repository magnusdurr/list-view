<h4>Version 1.0.beta</h4>
<p>
    The Vior'la Tau has been designed from the ground up by the EA:Ragnarök team, with some initial inspiration from the
    NetEA developmental version of the list. The Vior'la is focused on the larger Tau Battlesuits, with support options
    largely restricted to other suits, and drones. We also introduced Tau war engines such as the mighty KX139 Ta'unar
    Supremacy Armour. Compared to the Tau Sa'cea the list have lost access to several popular support options, such as
    the Hammerhead and Recon Skimmer Group, and the Fire Warriors has been moved to the support section. The Vior'la
    does not have access to Orcas and thus can not use air insertions.

<p>
    The Heavy Battlesuits has been designed for different roles on the battlefield, but all with one common mindset.
    They all have powerful shooting but with relatively low to-hit, meaning that you will have to use your marker lights
    efficiently to maximize the shooting from the Battlesuits.
</p>
<p>
    The list is meant to play as a ground based force with Crisis Suits, Broadsides, and Heavy Battle Suits as the
    damage dealers. The larger suits can be deadly when shooting, especially when targeting enemy formations in marker
    lights, but are weak in assaults due to high cost and low numbers. Make sure to protect and support them at all
    times!
