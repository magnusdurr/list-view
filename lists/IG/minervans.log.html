<h4>Version 1.0.beta</h4>
<p>
    The EA:Ragnarök Minervan Tank Legion is based on the NetEA list, but with a number of significant changes, most of which are inherited from the changes made to the Steel Legion army. The most significant change that is specific to the Minervans is the increase in Support choices per Core, which opens up for a greater variety of list.
</p>
<p>
    Formation sizes: The Minervans inherits the general changes made to the Steel Legion list, and also replaces the Leman Russ Platoon (with six Leman Russ) with the Leman Russ Squadron (which has four). Combined with the huge variety of Leman Russ variants that Minervans has access to, this will hopefully make them a more common sight. The Leman Russ Companies are now less flexible, but can still take Thunderers.

<h5>Additional nerfs, boosts & tweaks</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Stormhammers: The Stormhammer is described in the fluff as being exceptionally rare and capable, so its stats has been adapted to this and it is now a 0-1 choice in the Super-Heavy Company.</li>
    <li>Stormblades: The Stormblade has always had a hard time to compete with the other Super Heavy Tanks. To help with this its main cannon has had its range extended, and its Firefight increased to 4+.</li>
    <li>The Warlord and Reaver Titans, and the Stormtroopers, Vultures and Valkyries have been removed from the list, to reinforce the Mechanized theme.</li>
    <li>The Leman Russ Destroyer have new stats, and are able to begin in garrison. </li>
    <li>Salamander Scout Tanks have a different formation size, and the Salamander Command Tank has been removed from the list. </li>
    <li>Leman Russ: The Leman Russ Punisher has been added to the Leman Russ Platoon and the Leman Russ upgrade, both of which have also been reduced slightly in cost. </li>
    <li>Medusa: The Assault Gun Platoon has been included in the Artillery Battery formation, and the Medusa Gun now have different, more long range stats. </li>
</ul>
<h5>Version 1.0.beta-2</h5>
<ul>
    <li>In line with changes made to Imperial Guard Super Heavy Tanks, the Super Heavy Tank Company, Baneblades, Stormblades, and Stormswords are slightly cheaper. Baneblades has only 4+ FF, while the Stormsword has only 30cm on its Siege Cannon.</li>
</ul>
