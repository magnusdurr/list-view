<h4>Version 1.0.beta</h4>
<p>
    The EA:Ragnarök Iron Hands list is built by the EA:Ragnarok team with inspiration from the developmental NetEA list.
    The list has a strong focus on mechanized infantry, armored vehicles and Dreadnoughts and has access to many
    unique Dreadnought and Land Raider configurations. The list is designed for a ground based play style but also has
    some formations that works well when deployed from space. The list also has access to Thunderhawk Transporters as a
    way to air transport the mechanized infantry or armoured formations.

    Since the Iron Hands chapter has strong ties to the Adeptus Mechanicus the list has been given access to more
    flexible weapons configuration on their Titans. The list has access to a Techmarine character with unique abilities
    to "repair" armoured vehicles, and the list also has a unique Devastators using powerful (but short ranged) Graviton
    Guns.

    In general, most Iron Hands formations are powerful but expensive. Do not expect to have a high number of
    activations and do not try to do everything at the same time. Including both space drops, titans and air transports
    will almost certainly spread your focus too thin...
