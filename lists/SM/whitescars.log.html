<h4>Version 1.0.beta</h4>
<p>
    The EA:Ragnarök White Scars list is based on the NetEA/EpicUK original with a number of organizational and formation
    changes to differentiate the list further from the Codex Astartes. First of all a Core/Support split has been
    introduced (as in all marine chapter lists).  The transport restrictions in the NetEA/EpicUK lists has been lifted so that each formation
    is free to choose deployment option.
</p>
<p>
    We wanted more focus on bikes in the White Scars list, so the 8-unit Bike formations were made core, and regular
    Scout formations were replaced by Scout Bikes. The White Scars Bikes and Land Speeders has also been given two
    unique special rules to represent the extreme speed of the White Scars. The Bikes can consolidate longer, and Attack
    Bikes and Land Speeders can shoot better at full speed.
</p>
<p>In addition:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The Terminator formation was given Land Raider Crusaders as the default transport option. This reduces the size and prize of the formation, making it less extreme.</li>
    <li>The Vindicator variant without dozer blades (from the NetEA list) were kept and also made available in a unique formation of their own.</li>
</ul>
