<h4>Version 1.0.beta</h4>
<p>
    The EA:Ragnarök Slaves to Darkness list is intended to the be the repository for all the Traitor Imperial Guard stuff that was left over when Lost and the Damned became a pure cultist list. It also is a great alternative for those who prefers the Alpha Legion to be more generically chaotic than the main, Heresy themed, list.

<p>
    Making an "Imperial Guard with Daemons"-list is actually pretty hard, since the combination of IG's firepower with the Engage potential of Daemons means that it very easily ends up being overpowered. To combat this the list is very rigid, and only has a single core formation (that on the other hand is quite flexible). Unlike LatD it has no Greater Daemons, and has a fairly limited Support section. The 33% Chaos Allies section is on the other hand quite extensive, with plenty of alternatives for different builds.

<h5>Additional nerfs, boosts & tweaks</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Chaos Navy: For thematic reasons the Imperial Navy formations didn't make it into StD. The idea behind this is that it seems unlikely that Traitor Guard formations would be able to get hold of Imperial Navy assets like Thunderbolts or Marauder Bombers. Those kinds of assets are better represented by the Chaos Navy.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Version 1.0.beta-2</h4>
<p>
    The core formation was made slightly more rigid, as it was a bit too flexible before. Lesser daemons bumped by 5 points to cost the same as in Chaos Space Marine lists.
</p>
<h4>Version 1.0.beta-3</h4>
<p>
    In line with changes made to Imperial Guard Super Heavy Tanks, Baneblades are slightly cheaper, and only has 4+ FF.
