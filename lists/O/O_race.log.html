<h3>General Ork changes</h3>

<p>
    A new rule has been introduced for most Ork infantry and walkers: <i>'Ere we go</i>. This new special rule gives the Orks
    an extra 5cm movement when the formation performs an Engage action. The idea behind the rule is to make the Warband,
    which we feel should be the base for most ork armies, a more attractive option when field on the ground. Today most
    of the Warbands fielded are transported to the battlefield by Landas, which is a good option but should not be the
    only viable option for a Warband.

<p>
    The Fighta Bommers has been tweaked. Their Heavy Shootas has been replaced by Twin Big Shootas, adding a AT6+
    to the weapon. They have also been made Fixed Forward (FxF), which takes away much of the defensive flack
    capabilities of the Fighta Bommers. Their price has also increased by 25 points, as part of a price increase
    for aircrafts in general.
</p>
<p>
    Skorchas are a very powerful option in most Ork armies. We felt that the Skorcha was a bit too powerful not only
    compared to the other choices in the Ork list, but in general. Large formations of Skorchas could dominate the
    battlefield in a way that was very hard to protect against. We have reduced the save of the Skorcha to 6+ which we
    hope will make more susceptible to e.g. overwatch fire form garrisoned formations that they are about to set on
    fire. Hopefully we might see a mix of units in EA:Ragnarök Kult of Speed where Bikes or Buggies are brought in to
    protect the squishy Skorchas.
</p>
<p>
    The Gargant and Great Gargant has been changed in line with the general changes done to Titans across all
    EA:Ragnarök lists. FF and CC stats has been nerfed to 4+ and both Gargants has been reduced in size (less DC) and
    price. Another reason for the size/price reduction was to make the Bad Moon Big Mob list work better.

<h5>Additional nerfs, boosts & tweaks</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Landas now cost 225 points, and their Flakka-Dakka Turrets has been reduced to D3+1 shots.</li>
    <li>Stompas are now a Heavy Armoured Vehicle (H-AV) giving them 2 DC each.</li>
    <li>The additional Boyz & Grotz upgrade has received a price increase to 35 points, since the Grotz are a very
        powerful addition to the formation. At the same time the option to add a Boy without the Grotz has been reduced
        in price to 15 points.
    </li>
    <li>The Gunwagon, Flakwagon & Battlewagon upgrades has been further reduced in price by 5 points each to make the
        transported Warband more attractive.
    </li>
    <li>
        The Battlefortresses and Gunfortresses units has received a price reduction to 100 points each, while Gunfortresses have been reduced to 5+ in CC and FF.
    </li>
    <li>
        Gargants with the God Machine special rule now have the rule Stomp 'em Good instead of Split Fire.
    </li>
</ul>
