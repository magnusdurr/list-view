<h4>Version 1.0.beta</h4>
<p>
    The EA:Ragnarök Hive Fleet Dagon Tyranid list is heavily influenced by the F-ERC Tyranids, in particular the army structure, but with plenty of inspiration drawn from the NetEA and E-UK versions as well. Some key aspects are the absence of a Swarm rule (though this could appear in other Tyranid lists), and an adapted version of the Super-Expendable rule from E-UK.

    One of the main features of the list is that Synapse creatures are usually possible to target separately from the surrounding formation, making it possible to decapitate these formations, giving them a number of penalties to activation etc. Such 'headless' swarms can be absorbed into other swarms with remaining synapse creatures.

    The structure of the Dagon Tyranid list is one of its main features, making it possible to be very creative with formation composition. It has been a challenge to make it attractive to not only take basic Assault Swarms, though that is certainly a viable army to take.
