  "about": [
    "v1.0.Beta: The EA-R Iyanden Craftworld list owes its basic structure to the NetEA version on the list, with a number important changes and additions, most of which have been inherited from the process of making the 'main' EA-R Craftworld Eldar list: Biel-Tan. With the Wraithguard being reduced to 3+ save, Wraithblades got the same save. These units no longer being 4++ and Fearless allowed for making their formations somewhat cheaper.",
    "The Spirit Walker Wraithhost has been made a bit more similar to the other Wraithhosts, and the list has also gained access to a Wraithknight formation, using the 'Knight' H-AV unit type."
