<h3>General Eldar changes</h3>

<p>
    The EA:Ragnarök Eldar lists are a mix of NetEA and Epic UK. The Eldar has gone threw some significant changes in
    many areas to make different Craftworld lists more viable, and to cover for some of the weaknesses that could cause
    Eldar armies to have very skewed matchups against certain type of opponents. On a high level we have given the
    Eldars additional anti-personnel shooting options, more anti-air options (so that we might not see the mandatory two
    Falcons/Firestorms formations in all EA:Ragnarök lists) and boosted the Storm Serpents to make wraith gates a more
    viable delivery option.
</p>
<p>
    In an attempt to fix internal balance between the Aspect Warriors a number of changes has been made. Dark Reapers
    are now primarily a shooty long range support unit, adding good AP capabilities to the Eldars. Fire Dragons are also
    primarily shooty, with short range macro ignore cover weapons. The seldomly seen Striking Scorpions has received a
    boost to their CC to 3+ and Speed to 20cm making them capable of delivering an awesome amount of hits in close
    combat. We believe this brings them on par with the Howling Banshees, who have both longer engagement range and
    <i>first strike</i>. The Warp Spiders, which we saw as one of the stronger aspects, has received a sidegrade (or
    nerf) where they lost their <i>Infiltrators</i> ability but in return got 20cm move. This means they lost some
    engagement range but in return can consolidate slightly longer after the engagement. Shining Spears, Howling
    Banshees, Dire Avengers and Swooping Hawks has not received any changes from their NetEA stats. Exarchs and the
    Autarch has been changed to work better with the shooty aspects and a big change to aspect warriors in general is
    that you are no longer allowed to mix aspects in a single formation.
</p>
<p>
    The Holofields special rule has been changed to Holofields(x) meaning that the save is no longer fixed to 3+ but
    instead the Holofields provide a saving throw to the value of x. With this change the Holofields has been added to
    the Eldar Super-Heavy tanks. We believe especially the Storm Serpent will benefit from this change, to become a more
    viable delivery option and more attractive when compared to the Vampire Raider.
</p>
<p>
    The price of transporting Eldars in Wave Serpents has decreased. You can now add four Wave Serpents (typically the
    number required to transport a formation) to the formation for 150 points.
</p>
<p>
    Nightwing Interceptors has received som major changes. The range of their Twin Shuriken Cannons decreased to 15cm,
    but in return they now have two Bright Lances, 5+ <i>reinforced armor</i> and can be taken in formations of two.
    The decreased range of the Twin Shuriken Cannons also affects the Phoenix Bombers.

<h5>Additional nerfs, boosts & tweaks</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Wraithguards now have 3+ armor and has received a price drop.</li>
    <li>
        War Walker swapped their Bright Lance for an Eldar Missile Launcher, to provide another anti-air option to the
        Eldars. With this change they also have a decent overwatch capability. We hope this will bring the War Walkers
        more on par with the Rangers.
    </li>
    <li>
        Guardian Support Weapon Platforms has been changed to a replacement instead of an add-on, you can upgrade up to
        three Guardians. The Vibro Cannon has been added as a weapon option and the D-Cannon has received a power boost.
