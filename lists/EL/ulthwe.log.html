    The EA:Ragnarök Ulthwe list is similar to the Epic UK list, focused around the Black Guardian squads. The Black
    Guardians benefit from the price drop on Wave Serpents, and in addition the option to replace Wave Serpent with
    Falcons and more importantly Firestorms has been added. The Black Guardians also have a 1+ Initiative Rating, making
    the list in general more reliable.
