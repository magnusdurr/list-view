<h4>Version 1.0.beta</h4>
<p>
    The EA:Ragnarök Emperor's Children list is based on the NetEA version, with some elements borrowed from the E-UK version as well.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Compulsory Cult Marines</b>: In the NetEA version of the Emperor's Children, it was perfectly possible to play without any Noise Marines whatsoever, while the E-UK version enforces a great deal of Noise Marines, making the list quite expensive. The EA:Ragnarök versions of the CSM Cult armies tries to land in between these extremes with the core retinues being roughtly split between Fearless and non-Fearless units.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Faction Specific Terminators</b>: Most CSM armies now have Terminators with special specific stats and weaponry, while those of The 'Cult' armies are also Fearless. This of course comes with a significant increase in cost. Like other 'Cult' armies, Terminators are now in the Core section instead of Elite, given their high cost.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Characters</b>: No more Sorcerer Lord, but the Lord and Warlord characters now have different equipment oriented towards First Strike, and all have the Daemonic Focus special rule. This makes it cheaper to use daemons as semi-permanent additions to formations.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Daemons</b>: All 'Cult' CSM armies now has a free Greater Daemon point, as well as having a compulsory Daemonic Pact upgrade. This both gives them more personality and tighter relationship with their respective patron god, but also creates some interesting tensions in army building (the Greater Daemon might be free, but the Chaos Champion certainly isn't...). This also compensates the Cult lists for the lost flexibility in daemons that Black Legion now has. What the Cult CSM lists do have is access to better version of the Daemonic Beast, as well as high-end lesser daemons which costs 2 summoning points to put on the battlefield, which opens up the potential for extremely powerful formations if summoning over a few turns.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Thunderhawk</b>: The Chaos Thunderhawk is gone, partly because it has many other unique unit types to choose from, and partly as it was a better fit for a future CSM list, the Night Lords. As a slight compensation the Despoiler Class Battleship has been added to the list.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Daemonic Knights</b>: These formations are no longer 0-1, but are on the other hand fixed in formation size which makes it impossible to create the "death star", BTS formations of Daemonic Knights that felt a bit too obvious in the NetEA version. The stats of the Hell-Knight has been boosted to bring it to par with the Hell-Scourges. These are also no longer War Engines, but are intead of the new unit type H-AV, making them significantly easier to engage. The Hell-Strider has slightly different stats.
</p>

<h5>Additional nerfs, boosts & tweaks</h5>
<ul>
    <li>The Debaser, a faction specific Defiler, is introduced, based on the E-UK stats.</li>
    <li>The Questor and Subjugators have slightly different weaponry, bringing them more in line with the fluff, and have had their speed reduced by 5cm in line with other Warhound type units. The Subjugators are now in parity with the Questors in both capability and cost.</li>
    <li>Emperor's Children Dreadnoughts have slightly different weapons, making it more unique.</li>
    <li>Emperor's Children Predators are now a very common upgrade to formations in the list.</li>
    <li>Emperor's Children Terminators can trade one Sirenshriek Terminator for three Land Raiders at discounted cost.</li>
</ul>
