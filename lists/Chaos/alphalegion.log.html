    The EA:Ragnarök Alpha Legion list can be seen as a counterpart to the Raven Guard loyalist list, in that it has many
    small and fragile formations, as well as a great deal of strategic flexibiliy. There are many ways of interpreting
    the Alpha Legion's very obscure fluff, some being closer to chaos, others basically loyalist double agents. This
    list has as its base the relatively uncorrupted 30k Alpha Legion, but with the option of making the list more
    chaotic. Daemons, cultists and Daemon Princes are available for those that want it, but it is perfectly possible to
    play without as well.

    Since the EA:Ragnarök Alpha Legion isn't really based on any other list, this section will examine some highlights
    in how it differs from other Chaos Space Marine lists.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Anti-Air</b>: With no really good 30k Anti-Air unit to pick from, the AA aspect of the list is instead performed by the
    Imperial Guard Hydra. This happens to fit the Alpha Legion theme as well, since the Hydra is the Alpha Legion's symbol.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Alpha Legion Transports</b>: To reinforce the theme that the Alpha Legion is very close to loyalist Space Marines (and
    to compensate for the relative lack of daemons and heavy CSM formations) the Alpha Legion has the equivalent to the
    Space Marine Transports rule, has access to Air Assault transport, and has Drop Pods instead of Dreadclaws. This
    makes the Alpha Legion Terminators some of the most flexible in the game, since they can choose between deploying in
    Drop Pods or Teleporting.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Stubborn and The Harrowing</b>: To give the small and very fragile Alpha Legion formations a better chance of staying
    unbroken, they were given the Stubborn rule, which under most circumstances is an inferior version of the Space
    Marines' "ATSKNF" rule. The Harrowing is another compromise between giving the list 5 in Strategy Rating, and the 4
    in Strategy Rating that other Chaos Space Marine lists have.
