<h4>Version 1.0.beta</h4>
<p>
    The EA:Ragnarök World Eaters list is mainly based on the E-UK version, but has no access to Titans, instead
    orienting it towards the great selection of Khorne Daemon engines that exists in 40k.
</p>
<p>
    Split Retinues: In the E-UK version of the list, the basic retinue could be very powerful if many formations were
    taken, as Khorne Berzerkers were comparatively cheap for their size, and very hard to get rid of since the entire
    formation was fearless. The introduction Chaos Assault Marines retains the very aggressive playstyle of these
    formations while making them more vulnerable to losing Engages and giving retinues some shooting.
</p>
<p>
    Juggernauts and Bloodcrushers: In order to make a greater difference between Juggernauts and Bikes, and to enable
    the introduction of Bloodcrushers, Juggernaut riders now have better armour, better speed but no infiltrate, these
    formations must now get closer to the enemy than before. Bloodcrushers gives the list access to exceptionally hard
    Daemons that can keep pace with other Juggernauts. These changes were also made to enable the Daemonic Incursion
    list to work better.
